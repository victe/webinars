This webinar breaks down one of the most esoteric concepts in the tidyverse: **list columns**. The Tidyverse is based on tidy data which is based on tables. Tables simplify data analysis by making data easy to use, just like Arabic numerals simplify math by making numbers easy to use. But you may not know that tables can store more than data. You can use tables to store models, lists, and other tables in a **list column**. The table will store the products of your data analysis in an organized way, and you can manipulate the table with the familiar table-tools of the tidyverse. In this webinar, we will look at how you can make list columns and use them in your own work.
