## shinyloadtest Webinar

This folder contains material for the September 5th, 2018 presentation on the [shinyloadtest](https://rstudio.github.io/shinyloadtest/) package for load testing Shiny applications.

The presentation covers:

- The rationale for developing load testing tools
- The difference between the shinyloadtest R package and the shinycannon load generation tool
- The "optimization loop" methodology for performance optimization
- Demonstrations of recording sessions, generating load, and performing simple optimizations.

The `sleepy-geiser-old` and `sleepy-geiser-new` directories contain versions of the Geiser demo before and after making a simple optimization.

The recording is available at https://rstudio.com/resources/webinars
