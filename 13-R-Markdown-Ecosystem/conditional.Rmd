# Introduction

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

# Data overview

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .2, .1))
plot(cars, pch = 20)
```

# Model

Now we build a linear regression model:

```{r}
fit = lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
b = coef(summary(fit))
# b
```

# Conclusion

```{r child = if (b[2, 4] < 0.05) 'conditional-good.Rmd' else 'conditional-bad.Rmd'}
```
